# Hangman
This is a command line interface hangman game that I initially built as a JetBrains Academy project. I have since improved it to include words from the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) module. 

I plan to make other improvements to the code over time, and all constructive criticisms are welcome.

## How to use
Download the repository, navigate to the directory containing "hangman.py", and run:

```
  python3 hangman.py  
```
You can install all modules needed by running:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
