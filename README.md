# Hangman
This is a simple hangman game that I initially built as a JetBrains Academy project. I have since improved it to include words from the Natural Language Toolkit. 

I plan to make other improvements to the code over time, and all constructive criticisms are welcome.

## How to use
Download the repository, navigate to the directory containing "hangman.py", and run it.
